Data Science Assignment


📌 Introduction
This project analyzes two datasets to uncover key insights:
Frailty & Grip Strength Dataset – Examines the relationship between physical strength and frailty.
Student Performance Dataset – Investigates factors influencing students' academic performance through visualizations.
The objective is to identify patterns, correlations, and meaningful trends using Python and data visualization techniques.

📊 Data Sources


1️⃣ Frailty & Grip Strength Dataset
Attributes: Height, Weight, Age, Grip Strength (kg), Frailty (Yes/No).
Objective: Determine the correlation between grip strength and frailty.


2️⃣ Student Performance Dataset
Attributes: Gender, Parental Education, Lunch Type, Test Preparation Course, Math, Reading, and Writing Scores.
Objective: Analyze factors that impact students' academic performance.

📈 Data Visualizations & Key Insights


1️⃣ Math Score Distribution
📌 Visualization Type: Histogram 🔍 Insights:
Most students score between 70-80 in math.
The distribution follows a normal pattern, with no extreme outliers.
Math performance appears consistent among students.

2️⃣ Reading Scores by Gender


📌 Visualization Type: Boxplot 

🔍 Insights:
A boxplot helps compare score distributions across groups (e.g., gender, parental education) by displaying medians, variability, and outliers. 
It also aids in detecting performance gaps and identifying students who may need extra support


3️⃣ correlation between subject scores

📌 Visualization Type: Heatmap 

🔍 Insights:
A heatmap makes it easier to identify correlations between different subjects, showing how strongly math, reading, and writing scores are related. 
It also helps in detecting patterns in student performance, revealing whether excelling in one subject influences scores in other.


4️⃣ Reading score vs  Math Score

📌 Visualization Type: scatterplot 

🔍 Insights:

A scatterplot helps visualize the relationship between two numerical variables, like math and reading scores, revealing trends and correlations. It also aids in detecting outliers—students whose performance differs significantly from the norm..


5️⃣ Impact of Test Preparation Courses


📌 Visualization Type: countplot 

🔍 Insights:
A boxplot helps compare score distributions across groups (e.g., gender, parental education) by displaying medians, variability, and outliers. 
It also aids in detecting performance gaps and identifying students who may need extra support.
This suggests that structured preparation plays a crucial role in academic success.
